<h3>Good day!!!</h3>
<p>&emsp;Some of you know me or being with me, I think 5 to 6 months, and I was happy, to have you all. This is not a short, or even a long message, just simple message for you all. And as request, if ever you got this message, thru the inbox, please don't post this.</p>
<p>&emsp;First of all, thank you for being my friend, to all of you. What I did isn't enough as gift of appreciation. All of you didn't just a friend, but a family to me. </p>
<p id="myname"></p>
<p id="mess"></p>
<p>&emsp;To be honest, all of those messages are not enough as what you did to my life, as how do I wanna escape my stupid life. Helping you isn't enough still, it is just knowledge, but you give to me is a family, which is I want to have, also a treasure to me.</p>
